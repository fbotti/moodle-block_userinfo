Features:

This block intends to give the user a few links in order to navigate quickly 
through moodle. Besides it advices the user about unread messages and 
information about the last access to the LMS. 

Installation:

1- Place the userinfo folder (if you have downloaded zipped then you have to unzip 
it) into the blocks folder under the root of your Moodle installation.

NOTE: if you have downloaded this package directly from github.com/fbotti then 
you must know that this package has two branches: 
    * 'master' branch: contains last Moodle Stable version (today it would be 
the v.2.0.x)
    * 'MOODLE_19_STABLE' branch: contains the functionality for the last Moodle
v.1.9.x. 
If you have Moodle 1.9.x version then maybe you will have to checkout MOODLE_19_STABLE
version. Just type 'git checkout MOODLE_19_STABLE' in your console for tha.

2- Go to the notifications page and Moodle will automatically install this new
block.
